In GenerateITDpulse(ITDpresent, p)
look carefully at what channel leads and why modulation had the phase -3*pi/2

% Need to do to read in images within argument parsing

In TransposedIADs.m, delete lines 55-66 that read in the faces:
%% read in all the necessary faces for feedback
if ~strcmp(p.FeedBack, 'None')
    FacesDir = fullfile('Faces',p.FacePixDir,'');
    SmileyFace = imread(fullfile(FacesDir,'smile24.bmp'),'bmp');
    WinkingFace = imread(fullfile(FacesDir,'wink24.bmp'),'bmp');
    FrownyFace = imread(fullfile(FacesDir,'frown24.bmp'),'bmp');
    %ClosedFace = imread(fullfile(FacesDir,'closed24.bmp'),'bmp');
    %OpenFace = imread(fullfile(FacesDir,'open24.bmp'),'bmp');
    %BlankFace = imread(fullfile(FacesDir,'blank24.bmp'),'bmp');
    p.CorrectImage=SmileyFace;
    p.IncorrectImage=FrownyFace;
end

In TransposedIADsParseArgs.masker
Add near bottom:

%% Read in feedback faces
sArgs=readFaces(sArgs);

and need readFaces.m in the directory

Aspects of masking noise

% Bharadwaj 2015 J Neurosci
A half-wave rectified sinusoid at 40 Hz was used to modulate a 4 kHz carrier
40 Hz = 25 ms period - 75 dB SPL overall
ITDs = {50, 100, 200, 400, 800} us and 1200 for poor listeners
expressed in dB re 100 us = -6, 0, 6, 12, 18, 21.5 dB
Presented in notched noise (800 Hz wide notch, so 3600-4400 Hz)
bands of noise above (up to 10 kHz) and below (down to 20 Hz)
served as maskers to reduce off-frequency cues at SNR=+10 dB (=65 dB SPL)
masker BW = (3600-20) + (10000-4400) = 9180 Hz : 10*log10(9180)= 39.6
Spectrum level = 65 - 39.6 = 25.4 dB SPL/Hz

'Off-frequency notched-noise (notch width of 800 Hz) maskers, realized independently in each trial and uncorrelated across the two ears'
	Important difference from Dreyer & Oxenham who used correlated noises across the ears as they reported difficulties when the noise was uncorrelated across the ears.
	But the same notch width
	
% Dreyer, A. A., & Oxenham, A. J. (2008) JASA
Transposed tones generated by multiplying a 4 kHz sinusoid with a 125 Hz sinusoid that had been half-wave rectified and lowpass filtered (Butterworth fourth order) at 800 Hz (0.2 times the carrier frequency of 4 kHz).

a background noise designed to limit off-frequency listening contained a stop-band between 0.9 and
1.1fc (3600â€“4400 Hz)
(transposed stimuli range from 3.2-4.8 kHz assuming sharp cutoffs)
